# CSS Selectors Demonstration

This project showcases the usage of various **CSS selectors** applied to an HTML document. It is designed to demonstrate how different types of selectors target HTML elements and apply styles.

## Features:
- **Element Selector**: Targets elements by their tag name (e.g., `<p>`).
- **Class Selector**: Styles elements based on their `class` attribute.
- **ID Selector**: Styles a specific element based on its unique `id` attribute.
- **Attribute Selector**: Targets elements with specific attributes (e.g., `<li value="4">`).
- **Universal Selector**: Applies a style to all elements on the page.

## Files:
- **`index.html`**: The HTML file that demonstrates different CSS selectors.
- **`style.css`**: The external CSS file that contains styles for each selector.

## Usage:
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see how CSS selectors work in action.
- Modify `style.css` to change the appearance of the elements and experiment with different selectors.

## Example of the HTML structure:
- **Paragraph tags** (`<p>`) are styled with red text.
- **List items with the class `note`** have their font size set to 20px.
- **ID selector** targets an element with the id `id-selector-demo` and turns it green.
- **Attribute selector** changes the color of the `<li>` element with `value="4"` to blue.
- **Universal selector** centers the text of all elements.
