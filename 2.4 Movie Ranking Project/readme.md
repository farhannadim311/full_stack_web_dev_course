## ðŸŽ¬ Favorite Movies Webpage

This simple HTML document displays a personal top 3 list of favorite movies. It includes:

- A main title (`<h1>`) introducing the page.
- A subtitle (`<h2>`) for the top 3 list.
- A horizontal rule (`<hr>`) for visual separation.
- Three movie titles using `<h3>`, each followed by a `<p>` tag with a short personal note.

The structure is clean and semantic, making it a great starter example for practicing HTML layout.
