### ✅ **Option 3: Explanation of the Structure**

> This HTML example displays a collection of animals with corresponding images. Here’s how the structure works:
> - The `<h1>` tag is used for the main title ("All the Animals").
> - Each animal's name is listed with a `<h2>` tag, followed by an `<img>` tag to display the image. The `src` attribute points to the file path for each image.
>   - The images use relative paths, meaning the locations are based on the folder structure in the project.
> - This structure makes it easy to organize images and information in a clean and accessible format.
