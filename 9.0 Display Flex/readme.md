# Column Layout Methods

This project provides a simple overview of different page layout techniques in HTML and CSS. It serves as a visual index linking to example implementations of various layout strategies.

## 📄 Project Overview
- A `flexbox`-based navigation bar that links to different layout method demos:
  - HTML Table
  - Inline-Block
  - Absolute Positioning
  - Float
  - Flexbox
- All items are displayed in a row using `flex` and spaced with `gap`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)

## 🎯 Features
- `.container`:
  - Styled with `display: flex` for horizontal alignment of items.
  - Uses `gap: 10px` to space links evenly.
  - Background color: **gold** for visual clarity.
- List items (`<li>`) act as navigation links to different layout demos.
- Text is bolded via `font-weight: 700` on the paragraph title.

## 🔗 Linked Demos
Each link leads to a separate HTML file demonstrating the following layout methods:
- ✅ `html-table.html` – Using `<table>` elements for layout.
- ✅ `inline-block.html` – Using `display: inline-block`.
- ✅ `absolute-position.html` – Using `position: absolute`.
- ✅ `float.html` – Using `float` and `clear`.
- ✅ `flex.html` – Using modern `display: flex`.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understand various layout models available in CSS.
- Compare the pros and cons of each method in practice.
- Learn how to build a simple navigation UI using **Flexbox**.

## 📌 Notes
- Best viewed in a modern browser.
- Be sure each linked `.html` file is placed in the same directory or path.

> **Tip:** While older methods like float and tables are still seen in legacy code, modern layouts should use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** when possible for cleaner and more responsive designs.
