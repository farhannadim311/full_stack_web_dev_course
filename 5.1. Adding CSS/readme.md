> This HTML snippet demonstrates how to create links that will direct users to three different methods of adding CSS:
> - **External CSS** is applied by linking to an external `.css` file using the `<link>` tag.
> - **Inline CSS** applies styles directly to individual elements using the `style` attribute.
> - **Internal CSS** is written within the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` of the document.
> 
> The links (`<a>` tags) direct users to different HTML files where each method is implemented.
