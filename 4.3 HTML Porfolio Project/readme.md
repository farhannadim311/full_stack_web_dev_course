> This HTML structure creates a **portfolio page** with links to different projects:
> - The `<h1>` tag is used for the main title "Farhan Nadim's Portfolio."
> - Two project links (Movie Ranking and Birthday Invite) are added with images, each linked to individual project pages.
> - The `<hr>` tag separates sections for better organization and readability.
> - Links to the "About Me" and "Contact Me" pages are provided at the bottom of the page.
>
> This is a simple, clean design for a personal web portfolio.
