> This HTML snippet is a simple birthday invitation. The structure includes:
> - A main heading (`<h1>`) for the event title ("It's my birthday").
> - A secondary heading (`<h2>`) with the event date.
> - An image of a birthday cake using the `<img>` tag, sourced from an external URL.
> - A list of items to bring, organized with `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<li>` (list items).
> - A link to a Google Maps location using the `<a>` tag to provide directions.
