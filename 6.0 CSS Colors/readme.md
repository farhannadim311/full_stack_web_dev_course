# Colors Project

This project demonstrates how to apply CSS to modify the styles of HTML elements, particularly focusing on the background and text colors. The page shows how CSS can be used to change the appearance of headings and the overall webpage.

## Features:

- **Background Colors**: The webpage's background is styled with the color `antiquewhite`.
- **Heading Styles**:
  - **`<h1>` (Hello)**: The text is styled with `whitesmoke` color, and the background is set to `darkseagreen`.
  - **`<h2>` (World)**: The text color is set to `#FAF8F1`, with a background of `#C58940`.

## Files:

- **`index.html`**: The HTML structure of the webpage with color styling applied using embedded CSS.
- **`solution.html`**: The solution page that includes the same styles, showing the final result.
