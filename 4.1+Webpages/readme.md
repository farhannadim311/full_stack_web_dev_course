> This HTML snippet demonstrates how to add an image and link navigation to a website:
> - The `<h1>` tag provides the main heading ("Welcome to My Website!").
> - An image (`<img>`) is wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`) to link to the "about" page. Clicking the image will take the user to `public/about.html`.
> - The `<hr>` tag adds a horizontal line to separate content.
> - The "Contact me" link directs users to the contact page (`public/contact.html`).
>
> This structure is common in websites for offering easy navigation to important sections like "About" and "Contact".
