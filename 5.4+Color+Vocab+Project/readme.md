# Spanish Vocabulary Project

This project demonstrates how to apply **CSS Selectors** to style elements in an HTML document. The webpage teaches **Spanish vocabulary** for colors and uses CSS for visual styling. 

## Features:
- **Color Titles**: The color names are displayed in Spanish, each styled to match the color it represents.
- **Font Weight**: All color titles are styled with `font-weight: normal;`.
- **Image Size**: All images of colors are set to a fixed height and width of 200px.

## Files:
- **`index.html`**: Contains the structure for the Spanish vocabulary page.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that contains styling rules for the page.

## Demo:
The webpage uses CSS selectors to match colors with their corresponding names in Spanish. The color titles have their font colors adjusted according to the color name, and images are displayed correctly.

## Setup:
To view this page:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see how the color titles and images are styled.
2. Modify the `style.css` to experiment with different styles and selectors.

### Example CSS:
- ID selectors are used to color the titles based on the color name.
- Class selectors are used for styling the font-weight of all titles.
- The universal image selector applies a fixed size to the images.
