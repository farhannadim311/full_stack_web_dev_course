# Bootstrap Card Centering Project

This project demonstrates how to **vertically and horizontally center a Bootstrap card** using **CSS Flexbox**, while applying Bootstrap's prebuilt card component for fast and responsive UI.

## 💡 Project Overview

- A `flower.jpg` image card is centered in the viewport.
- Uses **Bootstrap 5.3.6** for layout, card, and button styling.
- Custom CSS applies `display: flex` with alignment rules to center the card in both directions.
